# IDAssure: From Image to Face, We Trace with Grace

**IDAssure** is a smart identity verification system developed by **Team Pretty Pixels** at **Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)**. The platform verifies user identity and age using a combination of Aadhar document analysis and live facial recognition.

## Known Constraints ðŸ”´

This application is hosted on **Streamlit Community Cloud**, which may occasionally experience the following limitations:

- **Cold Starts**: The app may take a few seconds to load initially after a period of inactivity.
- **Manual Reboot**: Due to platform constraints, a manual reboot from the dashboard might be required in rare cases.
- **Session Expiry**: If left idle for too long, the app session may expire and require a page refresh.

These are known platform-related behaviors and **not bugs** in the application logic.  
> **If the app doesn't load or shows an error**, it is most likely because the server has gone idle.

---

# Solution ðŸŸ¢

 For a seamless experience, we recommend:
- Refreshing/Reloading the page (sometimes twice).
- Waiting a few seconds if the app doesn't load immediately.
- Avoiding long periods of inactivity during use.

If the issue persists, feel free to contact directly to reboot the app.

## Project Overview

IDAssure simplifies identity verification by allowing users to upload their Aadhar card (image or PDF) and capture a selfie. The system then performs facial recognition and OCR-based DOB extraction to confirm both identity and age. It is suitable for portals requiring KYC, digital onboarding, or age-restricted services.

## Features

- Face matching using MTCNN and FaceNet
- OCR-based DOB extraction from Aadhar using EasyOCR
- Age estimation based on DOB
- PDF and image upload support
- PAN card support added
- Modern React dashboard with sidebar navigation
- Streamlit-based AI backend with JSON API

---

## How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   - Upload Aadhar Card or PAN Card (Image or PDF)  
   - Capture live selfie using webcam  

2. **Face Detection and Comparison**  
   - Detects face in both inputs using MTCNN  
   - Extracts 512-d embeddings using InceptionResNetV1  
   - Compares faces using cosine similarity  

3. **DOB Extraction and Age Estimation**  
   - Uses EasyOCR to read text from document  
   - Applies regex to extract date formats  
   - Computes estimated age using datetime  

4. **Verification Logic**  
   - If Match > 75% and Age â‰¥ 18 â†’ Identity Verified  
   - If Match > 75% but Age < 18 â†’ Underage Warning  
   - If Match < 50% â†’ Identity Rejected  

5. **Output**  
   - Face Match Percentage  
   - Extracted DOB  
   - Estimated Age  
   - Final Verdict (Verified / Underage / Rejected)

## Installation Guide

If you download the IDAssure ZIP file to your system, follow these steps:

1. Open terminal and navigate to the backend folder where `app.py` exists  
   Example:  
   `cd C:\Users\shant\Downloads\client\IDAssure\backend`

2. Run the backend:  
   `python app.py`

   You should see something like:  
   `PS C:\Users\shant\Downloads\client\IDAssure\backend> python app.py`

3. Open a new terminal tab and navigate to the frontend folder  
   Example:  
   `cd ..\frontend`

4. Start the frontend using:  
   `npm run dev`

5. Open the link provided in the terminal  
   Example:  
   `http://localhost:5173/`

6. The application will open in your browser.

7. Refer to the YouTube video for additional help.
